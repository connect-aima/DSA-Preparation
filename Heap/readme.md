To insert an element into a heap, we first add the new element at the end of the heap to maintain the complete binary tree structure. We then compare this element with its parent and, if necessary, swap it with the parent to restore the heap property. This process, called heapify up, is repeated until the element reaches its correct position where the parent is larger (max heap) or smaller (min heap), ensuring the heap property is maintained throughout.

To delete an element from a heap, we typically remove the root element, which is the largest in a max heap or the smallest in a min heap. We replace the root with the last element in the heap to maintain the complete binary tree structure and then apply heapify down, comparing the element with its children and swapping it with the larger child (max heap) or smaller child (min heap) as necessary. This continues until the element reaches a position where the heap property is restored.

To sort a given array in ascending order, we first build a max heap by ignoring the leaf nodes from index n/2 + 1 to n, because they are already heaps. We start from the last internal node at index n/2 and loop backwards to 1, applying heapify down at each node to maintain the max heap property. Once the max heap is built, we repeatedly swap the first element (root, which is the largest) with the last element in the heap, decrease the heap size by one, and then apply heapify down at the root to restore the max heap property for the remaining elements. By repeating this process until the heap size becomes 1, the array gets sorted in ascending order. This method works in-place, uses constant extra space, and has a time complexity of O(n log n).and space complexity of O(1)

To sort a given array in descending order, we first build a min heap by ignoring the leaf nodes from index n/2 + 1 to n, because they are already heaps. We start from the last internal node at index n/2 and loop backwards to 1, applying heapify down at each node to maintain the min heap property. Once the min heap is built, we repeatedly swap the first element (root, which is the smallest) with the last element in the heap, decrease the heap size by one, and then apply heapify down at the root to restore the min heap property for the remaining elements. By repeating this process until the heap size becomes 1, the array gets sorted in descending order. This method works in-place, uses constant extra space, and has a time complexity of O(n log n). 

 Heapify down is the process of taking a node and pushing it downward in the heap until the heap property is fixed.
