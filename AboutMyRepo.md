Stack

both Static (arrays) and dynamic (linked list)
Opertion (peek,push,pop,empty,full)

Queue
both Static (arrays) and dynamic (linked list)
Opertion (front,enqueue(rear end),dequeue(front end),empty,full)
Normal queue 
Double Ended queue
Circular queue
Prority Queue

Tree 
BST(insertion,deletion,searching,traversals(BFS->level order,DFS(pre,in,post)))
MST(using prims and kruskals)

Heap
min heap,max heap,heapify ,heap sort details are in heap folder
Graph
constructing a graph using adjacency linked list or vector 
traversals bfs and dfs 
dijekstra for calculating shortest path to each node

Hashing
its details are in scrrenshot with in its folder
